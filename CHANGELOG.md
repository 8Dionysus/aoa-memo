# Changelog

All notable changes to `aoa-memo` will be documented in this file.

The format is intentionally simple and human-first.
Tracking starts with the community-docs baseline for this repository.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- community-docs baseline established for this repository
- `CHANGELOG.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SECURITY.md`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- memo-side contract docs for `aoa-agents`, `aoa-playbooks`, KAG/ToS bridge exports, eval guardrails, and the operational boundary
- `docs/ROUTING_MEMORY_ADOPTION.md` to formalize router-facing inspect -> capsule -> expand memo consumption without moving routing policy into `aoa-memo`
- schema-backed chunk-face, graph-face, and eval-guardrail handoff surfaces with bounded examples
- bridge-lift provenance examples and validation coverage for new bridge/export and guardrail surfaces

### Changed

- roadmap and doctrine-facing generated surfaces now record that `aoa-routing` already consumes the live `memo` kind and router-ready recall contracts
- router-facing doctrine recall contracts and object-facing semantic or lineage recall contracts now publish an additive `capsule_surface` between inspect and expand
